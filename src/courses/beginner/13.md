## 13. Next Steps

### 13.1 Take the Class Survey
Take our 9 question [survey](https://forms.office.com/g/iLBz5P6WrL) to give feedback to fuel class improvement.

### 13.2 Take the Advanced Security Automation Developer Class
This class is one of a set of security automation content offered by the MITRE SAF(c) team. If you found this content interesting and you want to learn more about more advanced topics like writing InSpec resources of your own, we encourage you to check out the Advanced Security Automation Developer Class (shown in the table of contents on the left).

### 13.3 Check Out the Rest of MITRE SAF(c)'s Content
MITRE SAF(c) is a large collection of tools and techniques for security automation in addition to those discussed in this class. You can find utilities and libraries to support any step of the software development lifecycle by browsing our offerings at [saf.mitre.org](https://saf.mitre.org). Note that everything offered by MITRE SAF(c) is open-source and available to use free of charge. You can also reference all of the resources listed from the class on the [Resources Page](../../resources/README.md)

### 13.4 Contact Us
The MITRE SAF(c) team can be contacted at [saf@groups.mitre.org](mailto:saf@groups.mitre.org). We support U.S. government sponsors in developing new tools for the Framework and in implementing the existing ones in DevSecOps pipelines. If you have a question about how you can use any of the content you saw in this class in your own environment, we'd be happy to help.
