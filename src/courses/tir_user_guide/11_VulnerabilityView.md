## Vulnerability View

The Vulnerability View will display all of the Nessus data for you Boundary. From here, you will be able to change the status and severity of Nessus findings. Once you click the **Vulnerability View** tab, you will see a unique list of all the Nessus findings in your boundary.

The first column in the table is the **Vulnerability Name**. This field will display the name of the Nessus check. The next column, **CVE**, will list out all of the CVEs associated to this Nessus finding. The **Nessus Plugin** column will provide the plugin ID for the Nessus plugin that contains this check. Next, the **Severity** column will provide the severity status for each Nessus check. The **Risk Score** columnn provides a risk score (from 0-10) of this finding. Lastly, the **Affected Systems** column will tell you how many systems in your boundary have that Nessus finding.
