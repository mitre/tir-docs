The next column, **CVE**, will list out all of the CVEs associated to this Nessus finding. The **Nessus Plugin** column will provide the plugin ID for the Nessus plugin that contains this check. Next, the **Severity** column will provide the severity status for each Nessus check. The **Risk Score** columnn provides a risk score (from 0-10) of this finding. Lastly, the **Affected Systems** column will tell you how many systems in your boundary have that Nessus finding.
