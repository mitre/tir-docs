## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for General User functions for Test Ingest Repository (TIR). This guide is designed for authorized Information System Security Officers (ISSO), Information System Security Managers (ISSM), and System Administrators responsible for maintaining compliance and Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) for systems and/or networks, where TIR is deployed.

TIR is a MITRE Security Assessment Framework (SAF) tool, built in collaboration with Lockheed Martin, that is used to support boundary compliance, software compliance, and continuous monitoring.

TIR Users have access to certain features in the software. TIR Users have the ability to create new Companies and Boundaries. The user that creates a Company or Boundary will be assigned the owner permissions of that Company or Boundary by default. For Boundaries and Companies that were not created by the user, access will need to be granted by an Admin or Owner. This helps maintain required separation of roles and responsibilities within TIR.
