## Test Kitchen Destroy Stage

The `destroy` stage terminates the EC2 instances, Vagrant boxes, or containers that Test Kitchen created for testing.

Occasionally, the `destroy` stage may encounter issues if the hosting platforms have altered the state of the provisioned instance during your writing, testing, or debugging sessions. If you face any problems with the `destroy` stage or any other Test Kitchen commands, verify the following:

- The test target's login, hostname, and IP address are still accurate.
- The test instance is still running on the hosting platforms.

Sometimes, the solution can be as simple as checking if the instance is still active.
