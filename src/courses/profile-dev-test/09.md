## Types of Benchmark Updates

When updating the profile, you'll be making one of three types of changes:

1. **Patch Update:** These frequent updates cover missing corner cases of testing for one or more benchmark requirements, or improvements to the InSpec code for a requirement. These updates result in a new patch release of the benchmark, such as going from `v1.12.4` to `v1.12.5`. We aim to release these updates on a regular schedule, either weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.
2. **Release Update:** These updates occur when the STIG Benchmark owner releases an updated version of the STIG, for example, going from Red Hat Enterprise Linux V1R12 to V1R13.
3. **Major Version Update:** These updates occur when a software vendor releases a new major version of their product's STIG. For example, when Red Hat releases version 9 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Microsoft releases a new major version of Windows, such as Windows 2024 or Windows 12.

### Scope of the Update Patterns

The STIGs and CIS Benchmarks are scoped within the Major Version of the software products they represent.

Updates or amendments to a Benchmark's requirements are tracked within the 'Releases' of the Benchmark.

As we mentioned in the previous section, ***there is no concept of 'back-patching'***; it is a ***'forward-only'*** process.

Each requirement is indexed from their source SRG document, aligned to a CCI, and then given a unique `Rule ID` and `STIG ID` in the respective XCCDF Benchmark document.

Here is an example of various indices you may recognize:

```ruby
tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227'
tag gid: 'V-230221'
tag rid: 'SV-230221r858734_rule'
tag stig_id: 'RHEL-08-010000'
tag fix_id: 'F-32865r567410_fix'
tag cci: ['CCI-000366']
```
