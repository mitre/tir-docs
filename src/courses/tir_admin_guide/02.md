## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for Administrative functions for Test Ingest Repository (TIR). TIR is a MITRE Security Assessment Framework (SAF) tool that is used to support boundary and software compliance and continuous monitoring.

TIR Administrators only have access to certain features in the software. Administrators can configure TIR, and change permissions on Companies and Boundaries. Administrators cannot edit boundary details. This helps maintain required separation of roles and responsibilities within the TIR.
