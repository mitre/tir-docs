## 3. Account Permissions

TIR has two types of users, Administrators and Users. Administrators have access to the **Administration,** **Libraries**, and **Boundary** tabs. Users only have access to Libraries and Boundary tabs. TIR is setup as a hierarchical system with Companies and Boundaries. Users can be granted permissions to be Owners, Reviewers, and Editors for
Companies and Boundaries. A summary of permissions is show in Table 1, below.

This will enable the drop-down menu for the role field. To change the user's role, select the new role and click the **Save** button for that user. There is one limitation when editing roles, and that is that each boundary needs to have an Owner. If you are changing the role of user from Owner to Editor, you will first need to assign another user the Owner role.
