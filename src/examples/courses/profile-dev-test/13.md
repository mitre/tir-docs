## The `Release Update` Process

A `Release Update` involves creating a new branch, `v#{x}R#{x+1}`, from the current main or latest patch release branch. The `saf generate delta` workflow is then run, which updates the metadata of the `controls`, `inspec.yml`, `README.md`, and other profile elements, while preserving the `describe` and `ruby code logic`. This workflow is detailed in the [Inspec Delta](#2-inspec-delta) section. After the initial commit of the new release branch, follow these steps to keep your work organized:

1. **Track Control IDs:** Create a table of all new `control ids` in the updated benchmark. This can be in CSV, Markdown Table, or in the PR overview information section. This helps track completed and pending work. PRs off the `v#{x}r#{x+1}` can also be linked in the table, especially if using a `micro` vs `massive` PR approach.
2. **Ensure Consistency:** Add 'check box columns' to your tracking table to ensure each requirement of the updated Benchmark receives the same level of scrutiny.
3. **Update CI/CD Process:** Update elements such as the `hardening` content (ansible, puppet, chef, hardened docker images, hardened vagrant boxes) to meet new requirements. Ensure the CI/CD process still functions with the updated elements, preferably on the PR as well.
4. **Update Labels:** Update `titles` and other labels to reflect the updated release number of the Benchmark.
5. **Commit Changes:** Commit these changes to your release branch, ensuring your CI/CD process exits cleanly.
6. **Follow Patch Update Workflow:** With the above in place, follow the 'Patch Update' process, but expect a larger number of requirements to revalidate or update.
7. **Identify Potential Code Changes:** Controls with changes to the `check text` or `fix text` are likely to require `inspec code changes`. If the `check text` and `fix text` of a control remain unchanged, it's likely only a cosmetic update, with no change in the security requirement or validation code.
