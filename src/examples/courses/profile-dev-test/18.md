## Test Kitchen Validate Stage

The `verify` stage uses the `kitchen-inspec` verifier from Test Kitchen to run the profile against the test targets.

For this stage, the profile receives a set of tailored `input` YAML files. These files adjust the testing for each target, ensuring accurate validation against the expected state and minimizing false results.

There are also specific `threshold` files for each target environment platform (EC2, container, and Vagrant) in both the `vanilla` and `hardened` suites.

The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of these files, their structure, and the workflow organization.
