# Training Development Docs

Here you can find information for adding to the training courses that SAF offers.

We use [this theme](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/)

Run a local deployment to test some changes:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a branch and make your changes
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npm run docs:dev` to build the site locally
5. View realtime updates of the local build in your browser, or rebuild to update with new pages.
