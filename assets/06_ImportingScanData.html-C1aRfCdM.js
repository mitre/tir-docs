If you choose not to organize your data in this way, you will have to manually assign the scan data files to your systems. To begin importing scan data via folders, click the <strong>Import Results</strong> button in your boundary and select <strong>Folder(s)</strong> from the menu.</p><p>This will launch a file navigation window.
