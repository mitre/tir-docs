From this view you will be able to update the status and severities of each system in your boundary. Additionally, you have the ability to apply overrides for each of these updates. Override rules can be set on findings so that the status you assign to a finding will persist on the selected systems when new test data is imported in the future. This override feature should be used almost exclusively to set statuses of <strong>Not Applicable</strong> for checks that are deemed <strong>Not Applicable</strong> to your boundary.
