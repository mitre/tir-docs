For environments being accessed by a wide range of users, compartmentalization will be important. For smaller environments, the compartmentalization structure will not need to be as extravagant.</p><p>The owner of each boundary will be responsible for creating their <strong>Boundary</strong> inside of TIR. Before creating a boundary, please strategize on the access control elements of your boundary. When creating a boundary, the user will have the option to add a <strong>Company</strong> or add a <strong>Boundary</strong>. The <strong>Companies</strong> are used as a nesting structure to organize where your boundary is stored. The <strong>Boundaries</strong> will be a container that stores all of the cyber assessment data and will provide a workspace to address any findings. To compare to a traditional directory structure, the <strong>Companies</strong> will act as the higher-level directories and the <strong>Boundaries</strong> will act as the lowest level directory. <strong>Systems</strong> will be added to each boundary, and those <strong>Systems</strong> will be the equivalent to actual files existing in your directories.</p><p>To better illustrate this comparison to the traditional directory structure, please refer to the <em>Figure 15: Example Boundary Structures</em> below.</p><p>![Figure 15: Example Boundary Structures](../../assets/user-guide/CompaniesAndBoundaries.png &quot;Figure 15: Example Boundary Structures&quot; =300x700)</p><p>With that illustration in mind, let’s get started with creating boundaries inside of TIR.

That is; Boundaries can NOT exist at the root level of your <strong>Boundaries</strong> tab. A boundary must be placed inside of a Company. Aside from the root level, Boundaries and Company can exist at the same level and Companies can be created to nest Boundaries as much as needed. The role of Companies is limit user access to certain Boundaries.
